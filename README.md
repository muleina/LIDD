# LIDD: Lightweight Multi-System Multivariate Interconnection and Divergence Discovery
## Code is coming soon!!!

LIDD is a tool that identifies abnormal behavior in multi-system environments. 
Identifying outlier behavior among sensors and subsystems is essential for discovering faults and facilitating diagnostics in large systems. 
At the same time, exploring large systems with numerous multivariate data sets is challenging. 
LIDD employs a multivariate analysis technique that first estimates the similarity heatmaps among the sensors for each system and then applies information retrieval algorithms to provide relevant multi-level interconnection and discrepancy details.
